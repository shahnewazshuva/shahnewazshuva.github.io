The following questions will be addressed in this article:
- **What is Time series?**
- **Why is it important?**

$$x_{1,2} = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2b}.$$

\[ x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a} \]

$$ f'(x) = \frac{\delta f}{\delta x_1}, \frac{\delta f}{\delta x_2}, \cdots, \frac{\delta f}{\delta x_n} $$
